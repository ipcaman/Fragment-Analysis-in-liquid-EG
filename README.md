# Fragment-Analysis-in-liquid-EG
It contains the VMD-tcl-script for analyzing different fragments in liquid Ethylene Glycol (EG) which can be executed from VMD Tkconsole
Input required to run the script: replicated trajectories from MD simulation  
The scipt will enumerate fragments of size 3, 4 and 5 EG molecules
